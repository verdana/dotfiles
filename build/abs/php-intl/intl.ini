; The default value is empty, which forces the usage of ICU's default locale.
; Once set, the ini setting cannot be reset to this default value. It is not

; in order to inhibit the messages. This does not affect the return values
; indicating error or the values returned by intl_get_error_code() or by the
; class specific methods for retrieving error codes and messages. Choosing
; E_ERROR will terminate the script whenever an error condition is found on
; intl classes.
